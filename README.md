> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is only a showcase of the game. It provides the links to download the game and information about it. The game is not open-source and the source code is not available, primarily due to the use of assets which license does not allow redistribution. The game is built using Unreal Engine.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's indicated in the itch.io page (and probably somewhere else), that the game will be developed further, it's not the case. We didn't have the time to continue it, although we really wanted to. Hope you enjoy the game as it is.
